# Temprature-Controller-via-serial-moniter
This code can be used to control thermo stat temperature range using serial moniter.
Code is able to change default temperature value using serial moniter. This is the part of my project Digital thermo-stat.
To know more about code Please refer to my project digital thermo-stat.
I will try to write blog regarding this soon.
